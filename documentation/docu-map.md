# List of software development documentation for aTES system

## Requirements
1. [Initial requirements](initial-requirements.md)
   The document contains the set of requirements and concerns provided by top management at the start of the project.

## System models
1. [White Board with structure and data models](https://www.figma.com/file/VrYPEcgvBSM829wmFdYGws/aTES-system-models?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=Yzjce2WEfjwqSogH-1)
The board shows the system on different layers:
   - [Event Storming Diagram](models/event-storming.png)
   The diagram shows domain events in the aTES system
   - [Data mode](to-be-filled)
   Since the ES diagram is fully focused on domain events, we need to have other side view - data model.
